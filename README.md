# EzToolbox

A small collection of tools which I don't feel deserve to be alone.

## MenuInfo
Shows some basic information in the Openplanet menu bar, like:
- Clock
- FPS
- Ping
- Countdown to next daily cup (day, night, morning)
- OnlineChecker (see below)
- WhereAmI (see below)

## OnlineChecker
Checks player online status and optionally warns if offline. Useful if you don't want to spend time grinding a map if the record wouldn't submit anyway.

## WhereAmI
Detects where in the game the player currently is.
